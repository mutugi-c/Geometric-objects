# Geometric-objects
<p> This project showcases basic processes that involve working with geometric objects, such as:
<ul>
<li>Creating basic geometries e.g Points, Linestrings & Polygons</li>
<li>Working with attributes of geometries e.g centroids, area, & length</li>
<li>Reading coordinates from a file and creating geometries</li>
<li>Obtaining meaningful information from the geometries</li>
</ul>
